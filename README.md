# DynamicBayesianNetwork
Here I will try to build a dynamic bayesian network using R. 
First, I will do some exercises to get used to R and bayesian networks, later on I will try to build a dynamic one.
I'm using *"Scutari, M., & Lebre, S. (2013). Bayesian Networks in R: With Applications in Systems Biology."* for reference.
